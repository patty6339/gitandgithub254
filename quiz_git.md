d. It merges changes from the remote repository.  

### 6. Describe what a branch is in Git and why it is useful.

d. By using the `git clone` command followed by `git pull`.  

### 8. What is a pull request and why is it important?
a. A pull request is a command to update the local repository with changes from the remote repository.  
b. A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository, allowing team members to review and discuss the changes before merging.  
c. A pull request is a command to create a copy of an existing repository.  
d. A pull request is a way to delete a branch from the repository.  

### 9. How do you update your local repository with changes from a remote repository?
a. By using the `git init` command.  
b. By using the `git commit` command.  
c. By using the `git pull` command.  
d. By using the `git branch` command.  

### 10. Explain the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`.
a. `git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but does not merge them, while `git pull` both downloads and merges changes.  
b. `git fetch` creates a new branch, while `git pull` deletes a branch.  
c. `git fetch` initializes a new repository, while `git pull` stages changes for commit.  
d. `git fetch` commits changes to the local repository, while `git pull` stages changes for commit.
